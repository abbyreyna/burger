# Eat Da Burger
### Overview

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I made sure to follow the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Simply enter a burger name, 'eat it' and if you so wish, barf it out by clicking the cute little emoji!
